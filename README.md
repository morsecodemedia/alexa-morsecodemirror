# alexa-morsecodemirror
An Amazon Alexa skill to guide users to updates, roadmaps and how-to's on the morsecodemirror project.

## Disclaimer

To be completely honest, I had no intention of building this. I was only doing for the monthly dev perks, but they pulled the program for the moment: https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-developer-skill-promotion
The mirror will be an Alexa-enabled device in itself, so won't need to utilize an Echo for voice contorl.
